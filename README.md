# DIGIT-GENERATOR
Generative adversial network trained to generate handwritten digits

The MNIST dataset has been used to generate the digits

Two GAN models have been built using:
1. Dense layers
2. Convolutional layers

The generated images of 0 by the two GAN  models:
Dense layers | Convolutional layers
--- | --- 
![dense](https://github.com/prajvalsudhir/DIGIT-GENERATOR/blob/master/gan_dense.png)| ![conv](https://github.com/prajvalsudhir/DIGIT-GENERATOR/blob/master/gan_conv.png) 

Mode Collapes causes the images generated by the Dense model to be very similar and inaccurate.

The CNN model overcomes the mode collapse problem as seen in the Dense model and generates new images for the random noise input
